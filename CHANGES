	* defs.h: add a fallback for GCC_UNUSED

2005-05-04  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* makefile.in: add "." to include-path to pickup config.h

	* reader.c:
	apply fix suggested by Steve Dum for end_rule() in Redhat Bugzilla #112617.

	* output.c:
	correct a limit check in pack_vector() - report/analysis by William Evans

	* main.c:
	exit after printing version.  Otherwise "yacc -V" will exit with an erro
	after printing the usage message.

	* skeleton.c: replace a few -1's with YYEMPTY

	* skeleton.c:
	delete yynewerror (no one uses it any more, and it just makes compiler warnings)

	* skeleton.c: adapt yygrowstack() and related definitions from FreeBSD

	* yacc.1: add -V option

	* main.c: add -V option to print the version.
	simplify option-parsing by moving the duplicate logic for setting flags into
	new function setflag().

	* skeleton.c:
	move the actual definition of YYMAJOR and YYMINOR to defs.h (as numbers).
	add YYPATCH here so it can be tested by applications.

	* defs.h:
	add macros to define VERSION in terms of the (numeric) YYMAJOR, YYMINOR and
	YYPATCH symbols.

	* lalr.c, lr0.c, mkpar.c, defs.h, closure.c, warshall.c, output.c, verbose.c, graph.c, reader.c, main.c, symtab.c:
	reduce externs by making static the procedures that are not referenced outside
	the module in which they are defined.

	* makefile.in:
	the VERSION file holds the patch-date.  Define YYPATCH, so this will be
	compiled into the skeleton.

	* VERSION: patch-level for byacc

	* main.c:
	add "-o" to usage message.  It is too long for a single line; rewrite usage()
	to show one option per line.

2005-05-03  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* main.c: add -o option, to work with scripts that assume bison.
	simplify create_file_names() with a macro.
	simplify done() with a macro.
	adapt fix from FreeBSD for signal race, e.g., if done() is interrupted by
	onintr(), do not flush output via exit(), but use _exit() instead.

	* defs.h: remove unnecessary externs for main.c

	* yacc.1: add -o option

	* graph.c: remove unused parameter

	* mkpar.c, defs.h, reader.c:
	add support for "%expect", a bison feature from FreeBSD sources

	* lr0.c, reader.c, main.c, skeleton.c, graph.c, symtab.c, closure.c, mkpar.c, lalr.c, error.c, warshall.c, verbose.c, output.c:
	indent'd

	* configure: regenerated for 2005/5/5

	* aclocal.m4: miscellaneous updates (adds CF_INTEL_COMPILER)

2005-04-27  schmitz

	* defs.h, graph.c, lr0.c, main.c, makefile.in, reader.c, yacc.1:
	Sylvain Schmitz <schmitz@i3s.unice.fr>:
	add graphical output of the LALR(1) automaton for graphviz,
	associated with command-line option `-g'

2005-04-16  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* config.sub: update to 2005/2/10

	* config.guess: update to 2005/3/24

2004-03-28  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* configure: RCS_BASE

	* configure.in:
	add AC_ARG_PROGRAM to make --program-prefix, etc., work.

	* makefile.in: first cut of script to support --program-prefix

	* configure.in:
	reorder AC_INIT/AC_CONFIG_HEADER to make this "work" with autoconf 2.52

	* makefile.in: modify so DESTDIR works

	* makefile.in: use EXEEXT and OBJEXT

	* configure.in: use CF_PROG_EXT
	generate a config.h

	* defs.h: make this use the generated config.h

	* skeleton.c: add a forward-reference for yyparse()

	* aclocal.m4: add CF_CHECK_CACHE, needed for CF_PROG_EXT

	* yacc.1: remove the discussion of TMPDIR since it is obsolete

	* skeleton.c: fix a couple of minor compiler-warnings in the skeleton

	* defs.h: remove action_file_name, etc., since we use tmpfile() now.

	* main.c:
	use tmpfile() for opening the working files.  This quiets a warning
	advising the use of mkstemp().

	* output.c:
	Do not close temporary-files here, since they are opened with tmpfile().
	Just rewind them, and they're ready to read back the data stored in them.

	* makefile.in: turn on "make check" rule

	* yacc.1: various typography fixes prompted by Debian #100947

	* aclocal.m4, makefile.in, configure.in: RCS_BASE

	* README: updated to note that this is not the original
